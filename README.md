HR Attrition Analysis Project,

I am thrilled to share the culmination of my latest project: analyzing HR attrition data and crafting an interactive dashboard using Power BI to derive valuable insights. 💼💡

In this project, I began by meticulously cleaning the data within Power Query, meticulously examining for any null values or duplicates. Following this, I utilized advanced techniques such as conditional column creation to group data into meaningful categories, particularly focusing on age groups and salary slabs. This strategic approach has significantly enhanced the effectiveness of visualization techniques applied later in the project. 📊✨

📊 Unveiling 6 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 📊
I've identified and honed in on six essential KPIs. 💼💡 These carefully selected KPIs serve as vital metrics, providing comprehensive insights into various aspects of employees.

I've taken these 6 KPIs identified in my HR attrition analysis project and transformed them into insightful charts and visualizations each visualization serves as a powerful tool for gaining actionable insights and informing strategic decisions. 👥💼

I have used filters and slicers also for enhanced understanding and interaction. 💼💡

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey with Power BI and the innovative projects ahead! Let's continue harnessing the power of data visualization to drive meaningful change together. 🔍
